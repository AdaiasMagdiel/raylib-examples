# Raylib Examples

This repository contains a compilation of raylib library examples tailored for the Windows environment. Each example folder includes a `compile.bat` file to facilitate the compilation and execution of the corresponding example.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AdaiasMagdiel/raylib-examples.git
